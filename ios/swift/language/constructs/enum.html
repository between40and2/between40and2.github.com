<h1>enum</h1>
<p>An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with C, you will know that C enumerations assign related names to a set of integer values. Enumerations in Swift are much more flexible, and do not have to provide a value for each member of the enumeration. If a value (known as a &quot;raw&quot; value) is provided for each enumeration member, the value can be a string, a character, or a value of any integer or floating-point type.</p>
<p>Alternatively, enumeration members can specify associated values of any type to be stored along with each different member value, much as unions or variants do in other languages. You can define a common set of related members as part of one enumeration, each of which has a different set of values of appropriate types associated with it.</p>
<p>Enumerations in Swift are first-class types in their own right. They adopt many features traditionally supported only by classes, such as computed properties to provide additional information about the enumeration's current value, and instance methods to provide functionality related to the values the enumeration represents. Enumerations can also define initializers to provide an initial member value; can be extended to expand their functionality beyond their original implementation; and can conform to protocols to provide standard functionality.</p>
