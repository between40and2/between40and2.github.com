The width and height of the content area are smaller than the screen size and a dimming view is placed underneath the content.

If you do not want taps to dismiss the popover, you can assign one or more views to the passthroughViews property of the associated UIPopoverPresentationController object, which you can get from the popoverPresentationController property.</p>
