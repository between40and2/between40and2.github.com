<h2>Style issue</h2>
<p>Even for the same model, different occasion may have different style of dictionary structure. To differentiate it, there are currently following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>using ProjectCode.</li>
  <li>using __implmentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I once thought to add another parameters in these 2 instance methods. Later I found out it is not the best solution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Inheritance and Reference</h2>
<p>A model's DR should inherit the model's superclass's DR. so that its superclass's DR will process the properties defined in superclass; and this model's DR will process its own properties - no need to process its superclass' properties in duplciation way.</p>
<p>A model's DR should has-a the DRs of model's relationships. When coming to process the relationship, the relationship's DR will be used, rather than processing the relationship in this model's DR itself.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B is-a A</td>
    <td>DR_B is-a DR_A</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>B has-a X</p></td>
    <td>DR_B has-a DR_X</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>

<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JXPropertyMapping</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Big Picture</h2>
<p>While I am working on &quot;property (relationship) incarnation&quot; in Ruby for ExcelExport project, I realized that the property mapping is such a common place.. The mapping is worthy to be defined in an object !!</p>
<p>You know, such property mapping work DOES create new objects, but not new data or semantics. It is just a pure engineering work. Some works like an adaptor, connecting between different systems. Other passes data from one role (Model) in arch to another role (Dictionary/Hash)</p>
