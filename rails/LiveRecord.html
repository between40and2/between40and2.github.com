<body>
<p>LiveRecord is a supplementary of ActiveRecord in Rails. The main problem it tries to solve is, that every record and every property in record has its origin (who creates it and how - via what device) and its lifecycle (the changes), and these matter deserve to be traced down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LiveRecord should bring any trouble in use. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Device</h2>
<p>Device here takes a broad range, from IP/host of the client, to hardware device, to app (web browser or native app). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who - User</h2>
<p>Human or Robot </p>
<p>Login (membership) or public anonymous</p>
