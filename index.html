        <h3>Between40and2</h3>
        <p>It is Between Beijing (N40) and Singapore (N2, actually N1), that my pathway of life was shuffling in between during my working years. </p>
        <p>What I would like to present here are cheatsheets of below mentioned technologies that I am working with. </p>
        <h3>iOS &amp; RoR - Wired combination?</h3>

<p> Wired combination? In my past 12 years, I have used more than these technologies on GUI and Web. Finally I fell in these 2.</p>
<h3>iOS</h3>

<p>Before iOS, I was working intensively with Adobe Flex. The beauty of Flex's flexible architecture attacks me, plus its UI expressiveness. I was my dream back in 2005, to present fancier UI on Web via programmable Flash. In 2010, the year I came to meet iOS, there was the debate on whether Flash should be run on iOS, I was wondering whether I should go for iOS. I became so determined after I realised the depth and width of iOS technologies are much greater than of Flash/Flex. Another obviously plus on iOS is, I can carry on my program anywhere I go. </p>

<h3>RoR</h3>

<p>One feature charms me in RoR is the feature of metaprogramming. Ruby supports it and Rails fully uses it. It sucks me into deeper thought on metaphysics of programming. Why are we (as programmers) here? What can machine (software) facilitates men (programmers) ? I would like to share some of my ideas.</p>
