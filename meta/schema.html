<p>No Rooms for Hash/Dictionary</p>
<p>When I was with Perl, scalar, array and hash are 3 basic structures. Therefore hash is kept on my mind as a significant structure type. However, it seems many people do not take it as a big deal. In RDBMS world, there is no concept for that. Tables are regarded as arrays in DB.</p>
<p>Now I think of hash not as a structure for storage, but the tool/working structure for programming (to process data)</p>
